 ## INTRODUCTION : 
The pharmaceutical industry faces constant challenges in predicting sales due to factors such as drug category, seasonal demand, and market dynamics. Without accurate forecasting, companies risk overstocking, stockouts, or inefficient marketing strategies, which can impact both business performance and patient care.

This project addresses the challenge of analyzing historical pharma sales data to identify key trends and build a predictive model that can forecast future sales accurately.

## About Dataset:
The dataset is built from the initial dataset consisted of 600000 transactional data collected in 6 years (period 2014-2019), indicating date and time of sale, pharmaceutical drug brand name and sold quantity, exported from Point-of-Sale system in the individual pharmacy. Selected group of drugs from the dataset (57 drugs) is classified to the following Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System categories:

M01AB - Anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products, non-steroids, Acetic acid derivatives and related substances M01AE - Anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products, non-steroids, Propionic acid derivatives N02BA - Other analgesics and antipyretics, Salicylic acid and derivatives N02BE/B - Other analgesics and antipyretics, Pyrazolones and Anilides N05B - Psycholeptics drugs, Anxiolytic drugs N05C - Psycholeptics drugs, Hypnotics and sedatives drugs R03 - Drugs for obstructive airway diseases
